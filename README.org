* About JDOS

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codewithjom/jdos-repo/master/.config/qtile/scripts/.jdos.jpg]]

*Warning*: Use this script at your own risks!

A post-installation script that allows you to install a window manger and other softwares that I've configured. The configurations are available in [[https://github.com/codewithjom/jdos-repo][jdos-repo]], but I recommend to use this script to install the dependencies of the softwares.

* Installation

#+begin_src sh

  git clone https://github.com/codewithjom/jdos.git
  cd jdos
  ./run

#+end_src
