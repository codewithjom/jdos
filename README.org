*Warning*: Use this script at your own risks!

A post-installation script that allows you to install a window manger and other softwares that I've configured. The script will install all the softwares that I use and clone my dotfiles repo, you can check my dotfiles repo to let you know what softwares should this script will install! I recommend to use this script if you want to use my configs because in this script it has already the dependencies and ready to be use out of the box!
